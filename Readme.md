Traffic overcrowded is the major challenge in modern or busy city areas, resulting to increase
environmental pollution, delays, fuel consumption and increased travel time etc. To solve this
problem, AI- guided traffic management solution have acquired significant attention. This
project presents a digital traffic control system that integrates three main functionalities. These
are traffic sign classification, object detection from image and vehicle counting from video. The
system uses deep learning model such as Resent50, VGG16 and MobilenetV2 for traffic sign
classification. Among these three models, highest accuracy obtained from MobilenetV2 and this
model is used for future prediction. Also for object detection and vehicle counting, the pretrained yolov8 model is used, enabling efficient recognition of vehicles in images and real time
video streams. The experimental results shows the effectiveness of the system, with mobilenetV2
proving optimal for classification tasks and yolov8 gives accurate object detection and vehicle
counting. This findings suggest that, deep learning approach can control the traffic management
and reduce traffic overcrowded specially in busy cities, Future work will be focus on increasing
dataset variety and optimizing real tine performance.
